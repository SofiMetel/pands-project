# pands-project
 project for Programming and Scripting 

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. Fisher's paper was published in the Annals of Eugenics and includes discussion of the contained techniques' applications to the field of phrenology.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set#cite_note-5

You might do that for this project as follows:
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
    1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
    2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
    3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
    4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate

# Pandas Iris Project

The Iris dataset is a popular dataset used in machine learning and data science. It consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, with 50 observations for each of the three species - Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset includes four features - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The Pandas Iris project involves using the Pandas library, which is a popular data manipulation tool in Python, to analyze and visualize the Iris dataset. With Pandas, we can load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, which is a two-dimensional table-like data structure.

Using Pandas, we can easily perform data cleaning, data preprocessing, and data analysis on the Iris dataset. For example, we can use Pandas to drop any rows with missing data, rename columns, calculate summary statistics, and visualize the data using various charts and graphs.

The Pandas Iris project is a great way to learn and practice data manipulation, data analysis, and data visualization skills using a real-world dataset. With the popularity of Pandas and the widespread use of the Iris dataset, it is an ideal project for beginners and advanced users alike.

In conclusion, the Pandas Iris project is a great way to learn and practice data science skills using a popular dataset. By using Pandas, we can easily manipulate and analyze the data, helping us gain insights and make data-driven decisions.
