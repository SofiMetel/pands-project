# pands-project
 project for Programming and Scripting 

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. Fisher's paper was published in the Annals of Eugenics and includes discussion of the contained techniques' applications to the field of phrenology.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set#cite_note-5

You might do that for this project as follows:
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
    1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
    2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
    3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
    4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate
